    "1. **Best Case (Balanced partitioning):**  \n",
    "   - **O(n log n)**  \n",
    "     When the pivot divides the array into two equal parts at every step, Quick Sort achieves optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Case:**  \n",
    "   - **O(n log n)**  \n",
    "     On average, the array is split into reasonably balanced parts, making the overall complexity logarithmic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst Case (Unbalanced partitioning):**  \n",
    "   - **O(n²)**  \n",
    "     This happens when the pivot is consistently the smallest or largest element (e.g., when the array is already sorted in ascending or descending order).\n",

    "- **O(log n)** (for the recursion stack in the best and average cases).  \n",

    "### **Advantages of Quick Sort**\n",
    "1. **Highly Efficient for Large Datasets:**  \n",
    "   - It outperforms other algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort in practical applications due to lower overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In-Place Sorting:**  \n",
    "   - Unlike Merge Sort, it does not require additional memory for temporary arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Widely Used in Practice:**  \n",
    "   - Due to its efficiency and practical utility, it is commonly used in various programming libraries and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm:**  \n",
    "   - It is easy to parallelize, making it well-suited for modern multi-core systems.\n",

    "### **Disadvantages of Quick Sort**\n",
    "1. **Worst-Case Performance:**  \n",
    "   - Unbalanced partitioning results in **O(n²)** complexity, which can occur with poorly chosen pivots.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not Stable:**  \n",
    "   - Quick Sort does not preserve the relative order of equal elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Nature:**  \n",
    "   - For very large datasets, deep recursion can lead to stack overflow unless optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cache Unfriendliness:**  \n",
    "   - Partitioning involves frequent, non-sequential memory access, which is less cache-efficient than algorithms like Merge Sort.\n",

    "- Quick Sort is used in:  \n",
    "  - Sorting large datasets where memory usage needs to be minimal.  \n",
    "  - Real-world applications like databases, search engines, and file systems.  \n",
    "  - Scenarios requiring high efficiency and where stability is not critical.\n",
