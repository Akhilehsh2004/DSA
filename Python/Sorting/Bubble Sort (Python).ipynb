    "###  Time Complexity of Bubble Sort:\n",
    "1. **Best Case (When the array is already sorted):**  \n",
    "   - **O(n)**  \n",
    "   In the best case, Bubble Sort can recognize that the array is sorted and skip unnecessary comparisons. This happens if an optimization is applied (e.g., using a flag to detect whether any swaps occurred in a pass).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Case:**  \n",
    "   - **O(n²)**  \n",
    "   Even if the array is partially sorted, Bubble Sort performs nested loops, making its average-case complexity quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst Case (When the array is sorted in reverse order):**  \n",
    "   - **O(n²)**  \n",
    "   The worst-case scenario requires the maximum number of comparisons and swaps, as every element needs to be shifted to its correct position.\n",

    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(1)**  \n",
    "  Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it requires a constant amount of extra space.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Bubble Sort is inefficient for large datasets due to its quadratic time complexity.\n",
    "- It is mainly used for teaching purposes or when the dataset size is very small.\n",

    "### Advantages of Bubble Sort:\n",
    "1. **Simple and Easy to Implement:**  \n",
    "   - The algorithm is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for teaching basic sorting concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In-Place Sorting:**  \n",
    "   - Bubble Sort does not require additional memory space since it operates directly on the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adaptive for Nearly Sorted Data:**  \n",
    "   - If the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted, Bubble Sort can detect this early (with a small optimization like a \"no-swap\" flag) and terminate, reducing the number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stable Sorting Algorithm:**  \n",
    "   - Bubble Sort preserves the relative order of equal elements, which is useful for certain applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:\n",
    "1. **Inefficient for Large Datasets:**  \n",
    "   - Its time complexity of **O(n²)** for average and worst cases makes it impractical for large datasets compared to more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Number of Comparisons and Swaps:**  \n",
    "   - Even for small datasets, Bubble Sort performs many unnecessary comparisons and swaps, making it slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not Cache-Friendly:**  \n",
    "   - The frequent swapping of adjacent elements does not make efficient use of the CPU cache compared to other algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Practical Use in Real-World Applications:**  \n",
    "   - Due to its inefficiency, Bubble Sort is rarely used in practice, except for educational purposes or very small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Bubble Sort is primarily a learning tool for understanding basic sorting techniques. For real-world use cases, algorithms like **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**, or **Heap Sort** are much more efficient and practical. Let me know if you'd like a comparison or explanation of those!"
