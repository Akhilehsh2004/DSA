    "\n",
    "#### **Time Complexity:**\n",
    "1. **Best Case (When the array is already sorted):**  \n",
    "   - **O(n)**  \n",
    "   Only one comparison per element is required, as the elements are already in order. This happens when no shifting is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Case (Random order of elements):**  \n",
    "   - **O(nÂ²)**  \n",
    "   Each element is compared with all preceding elements, leading to a quadratic number of operations for moderately unsorted arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst Case (When the array is sorted in reverse order):**  \n",
    "   - **O(nÂ²)**  \n",
    "   Each element has to be compared and shifted for all previous elements, resulting in the maximum number of operations.\n",

    "#### **Space Complexity:**\n",

    "  Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional memory apart from a few temporary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Advantages of Insertion Sort:\n",
    "1. **Simple and Intuitive:**  \n",
    "   - The algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement, making it a good choice for learning sorting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient for Small or Nearly Sorted Arrays:**  \n",
    "   - Performs very well on small datasets or arrays that are already nearly sorted, often used in hybrid algorithms like Timsort.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In-Place Sorting:**  \n",
    "   - Does not require additional memory, which makes it space-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stable Sorting Algorithm:**  \n",
    "   - Maintains the relative order of equal elements, which is useful for sorting data with multiple attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adaptive Nature:**  \n",
    "   - The algorithm adapts quickly when the input is partially sorted, resulting in fewer comparisons and swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages of Insertion Sort:\n",
    "1. **Inefficient for Large Datasets:**  \n",
    "   - Its quadratic time complexity in the average and worst cases makes it impractical for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Number of Shifts:**  \n",
    "   - When the array is in reverse order, the algorithm performs a large number of data movements, increasing its execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not Suitable for Complex Applications:**  \n",
    "   - Due to its inefficiency with larger datasets, it is not used for real-world applications where performance is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases:\n",
    "- Insertion Sort is best suited for:  \n",
    "  - Small datasets.  \n",
    "  - Arrays that are already nearly sorted.  \n",
    "  - Scenarios where stability is important.\n",
