    "### **Time Complexity**\n",
    "1. **Best Case:**  \n",
    "   - **O(nÂ²)**  \n",
    "     The algorithm always scans the entire unsorted portion to find the minimum, regardless of the order of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Case:**  \n",
    "   - **O(nÂ²)**  \n",
    "     Each element is compared with every other element in the unsorted portion, resulting in quadratic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Worst Case:**  \n",
    "   - **O(nÂ²)**  \n",

    "1. **Simple and Intuitive:**  \n",
    "   - The algorithm is easy to understand and implement, making it suitable for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In-Place Sorting:**  \n",
    "   - It requires no extra memory, which makes it space-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Useful for Small Datasets:**  \n",
    "   - Works reasonably well for small arrays or lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **No Dependence on Input Order:**  \n",
    "   - The performance remains consistent regardless of whether the array is sorted, reversed, or random.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Disadvantages of Selection Sort**\n",
    "1. **Inefficient for Large Datasets:**  \n",
    "   - Its time complexity of **O(nÂ²)** makes it impractical for large arrays compared to more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Not Adaptive:**  \n",
    "   - Unlike Insertion Sort, Selection Sort does not adapt to nearly sorted arrays, performing the same number of comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not Stable:**  \n",
    "   - Selection Sort does not preserve the relative order of equal elements, which can be a drawback when stability is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High Number of Comparisons:**  \n",
    "   - Even if the array is sorted, the algorithm performs unnecessary comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Selection Sort is used in:\n",
    "  - Simple teaching scenarios to demonstrate sorting concepts.\n",
    "  - Applications where memory is severely constrained.\n",
    "  - Small datasets where the simplicity of implementation is prioritized over performance.\n",
